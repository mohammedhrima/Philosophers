4 philos:
0-1, 2-3, 4
0, 1-2, 3-4

5 philos:
0-1, 2-3, 4-5
5-0, 1-2, 3-4

0-1, 2-3, 4

===================================================================
1. create 2 functions
2. create threads
3. in each thread execute one function

0. philos will be struct that contains mutex_fork and next philo
1. set actions for each philo in struct: eat, think, sleep, die
2. call function:
    each function has the name of action
3. start with two philos

actions are:
    eat -> sleep -> think / simulation stop when I philo dies



step 1:
    build philo with actions
