4 philos:
0-1, 2-3, 4
0, 1-2, 3-4

5 philos:
0-1, 2-3, 4-5
5-0, 1-2, 3-4

0-1, 2-3, 4

1. create 2 functions
2. create threads
3. in each thread execute one function

0. philos will be struct that contains mutex_fork and next philo
1. set actions for each philo in struct: eat, think, sleep, die
2. call function:
    each function has the name of action
    reset the time of dying
    decrement the time of main action
    decrement the time of dying of no working philos


start with two philos

eat -> sleep -> think / simulation stop when I philo dies


- put your own macros for pthread functions
